# Buggy-Cars-Rating
Buggy Cars Rating is a deliberately flawed web application designed for software testing practice. The site allows users to register, log in, browse car models, and submit ratings and comments. It contains intentional functional, UI, and performance bugs to help testers practice manual testing, in a real-world-like environment.
Testing opportunities include:

User registration & login/logout workflows

Profile management and input validation

Car rating submission and display

Navigation and broken links

Cross-browser compatibility issues

UI/UX inconsistencies
